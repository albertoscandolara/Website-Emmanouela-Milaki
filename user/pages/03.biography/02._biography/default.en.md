    "My name is Emmanuela Milaki and I am a Registered Psychologist ( No. M. 303741 ) and a Registered School Psychologist according to the issued European Directive. I also specialize in Systemic Psychotherapy within the framework of a four-year training at the Cyprus Systemic Institute (this specific training program leads to the acquisition of the European Certificate in Psychotherapy ECP). I work as a self-employed psychologist and as a school psychologist at the Ministry of Education. The basic compass in my professional career is continuous professional development. For this reason, I systematically attend additional trainings related to clinical practice and psychotherapy.",
    'My studies began at the Department of Psychology of the University of Crete, from where I graduated with distinction (graduation ranking: 1st in the academic year). As part of my undergraduate studies, I completed my internship at the Psychiatric Clinic of the General Hospital of Rethymno. I also gained practical experience from my participation in the "Community University Partnership Programme" (CUPP), which was carried out in collaboration between the University of Brighton and the University of Crete, and aimed to promote the Mental Resilience of Teachers. After my graduation, I completed an internship through the Erasmus + Program at the Clearmind Pro center where I worked with the Counseling/Sports Psychologist Thalia Panagi.',
    'Subsequently, I completed my studies with Honors in the Applied Postgraduate Program in School Psychology (duration 3 years, full-time) of the University of Cyprus, which is recognized by the International Organization "International School Psychology Association (ISPA)". During my studies at the University of Cyprus, I was awarded a Scholarship from the A.G. Leventis Foundation for my academic progress, and graduated with a graduation ranking of 1st in the academic year.  During my specialization in School Psychology, I worked at the Educational Psychology Service of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Youth (MEYS) of Cyprus, where I had the opportunity to conduct assessments and implement individual and group interventions with children and adolescents of all levels of education. In the course of my duties I also gained significant experience in counselling parents, children/adolescents and teachers, and collaborated with other specialists. I also undertook various tasks at the University of Cyprus, both in research positions (e.g. I worked as a research assistant in the European Union-funded “ The Neurobid Project ”), as well as as a teaching assistant, and delivered lectures and laboratory courses to undergraduate psychology students.',
    "At the beginning of my professional career, I worked as a psychologist in various psychological centers, as well as in a well-known psychiatrist's office in Nicosia. I have also worked part-time as a Psychology teacher (AS/A Level Psychology Teacher) at the private school The Junior & Senior School. Finally, I have previous experience as a school psychologist in the Educational Psychology Service of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Youth (YPPAN) of Cyprus (fixed-term position).",
