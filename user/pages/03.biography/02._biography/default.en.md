I also specialize in <strong>Systemic Psychotherapy</strong> within the framework of a <strong>four-year training</strong> at the Cyprus Systemic Institute (this specific training program leads to the acquisition of the <strong>European Certificate in Psychotherapy ECP</strong>). I work as a <strong>self-employed psychologist</strong> and as a <strong>school psychologist at the Ministry of Education</strong>. The basic compass in my professional career is continuous professional development. For this reason, I systematically attend additional trainings related to clinical practice and psychotherapy.",

    'My studies began at the <strong>Department of Psychology</strong> of the University of Crete, from where I graduated with <strong>distinction</strong> (<strong>graduation ranking: 1st in the academic year</strong>). As part of my undergraduate studies, I completed my internship at the <strong>Psychiatric Clinic</strong> of the General Hospital of Rethymno. I also gained practical experience from my participation in the "<strong>Community University Partnership Programme</strong>" (<strong>CUPP</strong>), which was carried out in collaboration between the University of Brighton and the University of Crete, and aimed to promote the Mental Resilience of Teachers. After my graduation, I completed an internship through the <strong>Erasmus + Program at the Clearmind Pro center</strong> where I worked with the Counseling/Sports Psychologist Thalia Panagi.',

    'Subsequently, I completed my studies with <strong>Honors</strong> in the <strong>Applied Postgraduate Program in School Psychology</strong> (<strong>duration 3 years, full-time</strong>) of the University of Cyprus, which is recognized by the International Organization "<strong>International School Psychology Association</strong>" (<strong>ISPA</strong>). During my studies at the University of Cyprus, I was awarded a <strong>Scholarship from the A.G.

During my specialization in School Psychology, I worked at the <strong>Educational Psychology Service of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Youth (MEYS) of Cyprus</strong>, where I had the opportunity to conduct assessments and implement individual and group interventions with children and adolescents of all levels of education. In the course of my duties I also gained significant experience in counselling with parents, children/adolescents and teachers, and collaborated with other specialists. I also undertook various tasks at the University of Cyprus, both in research positions (e.g. I worked as a research assistant in the European Union-funded "<strong>The Neurobid Project</strong>"), as well as as a teaching assistant, and delivered lectures and laboratory courses to undergraduate psychology students.',

    "At the beginning of my professional career, I worked as a <strong>psychologist</strong> in various <strong>psychological centers</strong>, as well as in a well-known <strong>psychiatrist's office in Nicosia</strong>. I have also worked part-time as a <strong>Psychology teacher</strong> (<strong>AS/A Level Psychology Teacher</strong>) at the private school <strong>The Junior & Senior School</strong>.
