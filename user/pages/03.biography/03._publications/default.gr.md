      This research examines the role of emotion regulation as a possible 
      underlying mechanism affecting the way children involved in bullying 
      and victimization could differentially react in fearful situations. 
      Implications on school-based prevention and intervention programs are also discussed.

  - title: "Insecurity in the marital attachment and child adjustment difficulties: The mediating role of co-parenting"
    authors: ["Milaki, E.", "Giovazolias, T."]
    date: "2021-07"
    conference: "42nd Annual Conference of the International School Psychology Association (ISPA)"
    description: >
      This research investigates the impact that insecurity in parents' marital 
      attachment can have on co-parenting (the parents' ability to work together 
      on the care and upbringing of children for whom they share responsibility). 
      It also examines, how in turn, this can affect children's adjustment. 
      Finally, the importance of attachment-based couples therapy, as well as 
      intervention practices aiming at developing co-parenting skills are discussed.
