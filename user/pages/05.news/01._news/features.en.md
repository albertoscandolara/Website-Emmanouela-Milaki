    subtitle: "Article about the ClearMindPro Sports Psychology center - Sport Psychology Services"
    date: 19/10/2017
    description: 'Many athletes fall into an "all or nothing" mindset, driven by a deep need to prove their worth. This can lead to either extreme effort or complete withdrawal. The fear of failure often causes them to avoid trying, so they can blame defeat on lack of effort rather than lack of ability. True progress comes from believing in oneself, setting realistic goals, and learning from setbacks rather than justifying them.'
