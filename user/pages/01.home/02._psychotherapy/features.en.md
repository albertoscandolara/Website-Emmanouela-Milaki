item_paragraph: "Psychotherapy is often associated to a journey, where therapist and client are invited to explore together the complex paths of the inner world.\n\nDuring therapy, my goal is to provide a safe framework of acceptance and understanding that will allow the person to freely express their thoughts, feelings and concerns, at their own personal pace. With the creation of a relationship of trust as my main focus, I try to offer each person individually what they need to find their inner peace and personal balance.\n\nIn the journey of psychotherapy, the client \"brings\" with him his personal story, which is related to his personal needs and influences the way he feels, thinks and acts. Through an attitude of respect for his uniqueness, we will try together to come one step closer to self-knowledge, self-acceptance and self-love and the subsequent change.\n"
