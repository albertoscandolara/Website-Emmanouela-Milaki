item_paragraph: "The basic approach I follow in psychotherapy is the Systemic and Narrative approach. However, I also use many elements of other theoretical approaches (e.g. Cognitive Behavioral, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Psychodynamic, Existential, etc.), depending on the needs of the individual.\n\n Of great value to me is the ongoing professional development through training and the systematic monitoring of international bibliography regarding the use of empirically documented interventions in psychotherapy.\n\n At the same time, compliance with the code of ethics and the protection of personal data is an integral part of my work."
