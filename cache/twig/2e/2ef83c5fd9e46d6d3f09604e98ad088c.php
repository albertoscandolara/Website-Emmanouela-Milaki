                            <p>My name is Emmanuela Milaki and I am a Registered Psychologist ( No. M. 303741 ) and a Registered School Psychologist according to the issued European Directive. I also specialize in Systemic Psychotherapy within the framework of a four-year training at the Cyprus Systemic Institute (this specific training program leads to the acquisition of the European Certificate in Psychotherapy ECP). I work as a self-employed psychologist and as a school psychologist at the Ministry of Education. The basic compass in my professional career is continuous professional development. For this reason, I systematically attend additional trainings related to clinical practice and psychotherapy.</p>
                            <p>My studies began at the Department of Psychology of the University of Crete, from where I graduated with distinction (graduation ranking: 1st in the academic year). As part of my undergraduate studies, I completed my internship at the Psychiatric Clinic of the General Hospital of Rethymno. I also gained practical experience from my participation in the &quot;Community University Partnership Programme&quot; (CUPP), which was carried out in collaboration between the University of Brighton and the University of Crete, and aimed to promote the Mental Resilience of Teachers. After my graduation, I completed an internship through the Erasmus + Program at the Clearmind Pro center where I worked with the Counseling/Sports Psychologist Thalia Panagi.</p>
                            <p>Subsequently, I completed my studies with Honors in the Applied Postgraduate Program in School Psychology (duration 3 years, full-time) of the University of Cyprus, which is recognized by the International Organization &quot;International School Psychology Association (ISPA)&quot;. During my studies at the University of Cyprus, I was awarded a Scholarship from the A.G. Leventis Foundation for my academic progress, and graduated with a graduation ranking of 1st in the academic year.  During my specialization in School Psychology, I worked at the Educational Psychology Service of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Youth (MEYS) of Cyprus, where I had the opportunity to conduct assessments and implement individual and group interventions with children and adolescents of all levels of education. In the course of my duties I also gained significant experience in counselling parents, children/adolescents and teachers, and collaborated with other specialists. I also undertook various tasks at the University of Cyprus, both in research positions (e.g. I worked as a research assistant in the European Union-funded “ The Neurobid Project ”), as well as as a teaching assistant, and delivered lectures and laboratory courses to undergraduate psychology students.</p>
                            <p>At the beginning of my professional career, I worked as a psychologist in various psychological centers, as well as in a well-known psychiatrist&#039;s office in Nicosia. I have also worked part-time as a Psychology teacher (AS/A Level Psychology Teacher) at the private school The Junior &amp; Senior School. Finally, I have previous experience as a school psychologist in the Educational Psychology Service of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Youth (YPPAN) of Cyprus (fixed-term position).</p>
